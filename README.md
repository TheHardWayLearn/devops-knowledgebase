Characteristics Of DevOps Work:
# Different projects/products usually have many similar requirements or overlapped tasks.
# Most tasks are off the record and trivial in project planning, therefore hard to track effort for credit in-return
# If we fail to foresee potential risks of critical envs, DevOps life can easily be frustrating and fruitless.
# All team members may contact with DevOps, so watch out low efficiency of communication.

We maintain current JIRA story, in hope of:
# Standardize routine work with minimum effort and maximum output.
# Separate what tasks need intensive communication/prompt response from those tasks don't need.
# Measure key tasks by statistics and generate visualize  report.
# Figure out a way to keep things/tasks in order and properly tracked
